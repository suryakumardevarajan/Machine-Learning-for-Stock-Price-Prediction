# Machine-Learning-for-Stock-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning for Stock Price Prediction using regression and LSTM model



In this Project, we will train the regression and deep neural network models to predict the future stock price. The model will be trained using historical stock price data along with the voulume of transactions. This is a part of udemy project of Python and Machine Learning for Financial Analysis. This is made as an simple project for learning.
